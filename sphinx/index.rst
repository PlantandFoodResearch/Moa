*Command line workflows in bioinformatics*

Moa aims to assist a bioinformatician to organize, document, share,
inspect, execute and repeat workflows in a command line environment -
without losing any of the flexibility of the command line (see
:ref:`goals`).


**NOTE: The software (and manual) are under development. Things might change.**

Introduction
============

These days, generating massive amounts of data is an everyday element
of biological research; and almost all projects have a computational
biology, or bioinformatics, components. Such embedded work commonly
consists of chaining a number of 3\ :sup:`rd` party tools together,
often with some data manipulation in between the steps. It is
important to have such projects properly organized, particularly when
a projects grows bigger.

There are many different ways to organize bioinformatics
projects. Many bioinformaticians use the command line or tailor made
scripts (or Makefiles) to organize and automate their work. This
approach has obvious advantages, most importantly
flexibility. Potential downsides to a scripting approach is that a
project easily becomes disorganized and hard to understand, unless
measures are taken. Moa hopes to make the organization of a command
line project easier.
