*Command line workflows for bioinformatics*

Moa aims to assist a bioinformatician to organize, document, share,
execute and repeat workflows in a command line environment without
losing any of the flexibility of the command line, and, at all times
giving the user full access to all aspects of the workflow (see also
:ref:`goals`).


**NOTE: The software (and manual) are under development. Things might change.**
